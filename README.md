# Garance
## **The need**

**Garance ASBL**, a non-profit that helps women who are victim of violence, and offers self-defense workshops.

a website was redesigned for them by a team from the Brussels Johnson 2.9 startup.
The redesign layouts were validated by the customer.

The end-goal would be to turn it into a CMS-driven website (WordPress would be a good candidate), but we need an intermediary step : an html+css+js prototype made of the layouts images converted into static html pages.

## **Your mission**

At this stage, we need a team to convert the twenty-ish static layouts into an html,css,js high-fidelity prototype (meaning: it looks like the layout). This is sometimes called "frontend integration".

So the deploy strategy would be to work on a GitHub Pages hosted prototype, (html,css, a little js) with no CMS.

A next group in September will then convert these static html pages into a WordPress Theme, that the client will be able to use for his new website.

## **Skills involved**

  - [ ]  html, css (+sass), javascript, jquery or alternative
  - [ ]  git
  - [ ]  bootstrap (or equivalent)
  - [ ]  figma.com
  - [ ]  GitHub Pages
  - [ ]  Client management
  - [ ]  working knowledge of french (to communicate with the client)
